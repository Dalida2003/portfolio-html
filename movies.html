    <h3>The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023)</h3>
    <p>"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes" tells about the arbitrariness of evil. 
        The mad doctor Viola Davis, who developed The Hunger Games and is still experimenting with them,
         looks a lot like the angel of death. The eagles on the red flags of the Capitol also make sense 
         in terms of reference. The torture regime, in which fascism reigns supreme and innocent children 
         are forced to fight each other to the death like gladiators in the arena, is covered with a thick 
         layer of disgusting spectacle. The result is a psychotic technocracy. Not only the random violence, 
         but also its psychological brutality is more palpable than in previous films.

    <h3>Barbie (2023)</h3>
    <p>The most common stereotypical Barbie lives in a gorgeous pink Barbiland, and her every day is perfect. 
        She changes outfits, sunbathes on the beach, spends time with other Barbies, the day ends with a noisy dance party, 
        and in this positive mess with sequins, Ken in love is just an appendix to Barbie. One day, the doll is visited by thoughts 
        of death, and her feet, made under high-heeled shoes, suddenly become flat. To figure out what is happening and return to the 
        familiar plastic world, Barbie will have to go to the real world and find her girl mistress there. Ken, who cannot imagine 
        life without his idol, follows her.
    </p>

    <h3>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2003)</h3>
    <p>Miles Morales is catapulted through the multiverse, where he encounters a team of Spider-Men tasked with protecting its very 
        existence. When the heroes argue about how to deal with a new threat, Miles must rethink what it means to be a hero.
